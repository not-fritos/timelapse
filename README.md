# timelapse

FFMPEG scripts written in python to convert a series of videos into pictures 
and then back into a timelapse. 

## Further work

Considering how rarely I need to make timelapses, I probably won't really look 
into building a cleaner UI for this and instead just tweak it when I need it.
Also these scripts really just take advantage of using FFMPEG to do all the 
heavy lifting anyway and doesn't really add too much else.

Might be fun to combine to use this as a testing ground for a TUI later down
the line though.

## Inspiration

This project was made specifically to make a timelapse of my roadtrip from San
Diego to Madison in 2025. I used the following articles and forum posts to
actually process the videos and then co-wrote it with Gemini.
